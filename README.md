### :page_with_curl: When will Pull Request be accepted ?
- You should contribute at least 2 code-files/journals/blogs etc.
- Points that will be considered while validation :
  1. If contributing a code file you should mention proper problem statement at the start of your file (Comment it)
  2. Code should not be directly copied from any website like geeksforgeeks, tutorialspoint etc as there will be a plagiarism check for the same.
  3. Your work should be placed in an appropriate folder and should not change the rest of the directory structure. 
- Once all the above factors are verified by our Gyaanibuddies your pull request will be accepted!
